# Applied Data science Capstone - IBM
Capstone project for the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate

### Objective
Build a classification machine learning model using information from previous launches to predict the success of landing the Falcon-9 first stage.

## Project Structure:

## Data Collection - API and Web Scrapping
Collect Data about past Falcon-9 SpaceX launches. 
Use the SpaceX REST API endpoints (api.spacexdata.com/v4/) to retrieve the desired data and collected information stored in the HTML table from the SpaceX (Falcon 9) Launches Wikipedia page.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - DataViz and SQL
Conduct exploratory data analysis by manipulating data in a Pandas data frame and SQL (sort and delect data). Using Matplotlib and Seaborn to plot the graphs to extract meaningful patterns to guide the modeling process.

## Interactive Visual Analytics and Dashboards - Follium and Ploty Dash
Build an interactive dashboard that contains pie charts and scatter plots to analyze data with the Plotly Dash Python library. Generate interactive maps, plot coordinates, and mark clusters using Follium.

## Predictive Analysis - Machine Learning Classification Model
Use machine learning to determine if the first stage of Falcon 9 will land successfully and find the best Hyperparameter for SVM, Classification Trees, and Logistic Regression.
